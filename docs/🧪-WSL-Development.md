A look at how development flows from a luxurious Windows desktop through WSL and into Proxmox-backed staging—with Ansible and Tolkien cheering from the sidelines.

## 💻 Why WSL Works So Well
My dev environment blends the best of both realms:

| Feature | Benefit | 
|---|---|
| 🖥️ Premium Desktop | i7-12700KF, 64GB RAM, RTX 4070, 38" display—dev paradise | 
| 🧠 Linux CLI Fluency | Ubuntu/Bash feels like home | 
| ⚙️ Ansible-Ready | Roles run seamlessly from within WSL | 
| ☁️ kubectl Connected | Direct access to the homelab cluster from your terminal | 
| ✨ VS Code Integration | Launched from Bash, UI on Windows—no SSH contortions | 
| 🚀 Node.js Workflow | Clean runtime behavior, perfect for frontend dev | 
| 📜 Bash History FTW | Troubleshooting notes live right under your fingertips | 


## 🧬 Proxmox, Iluvatar, and the Realm Structure
My Proxmox VE host, Iluvatar, powers the entire ecosystem. Resource pools are thematically mapped:
| Pool | Purpose | 
|---|---|
| 🌲 Mirkwood | Dev/test workloads—dynamic, expendable, mysterious | 
| ✨ Lothlorien | Production workloads—resilient, elegant, evergreen | 


## 🎛️ Multipass + MicroK8s for Local Testing
When you want fast, reproducible integration environments without touching Proxmox, you spin up disposable clusters inside WSL using:
- [Multipass](https://multipass.run/): lightweight Ubuntu VMs
- MicroK8s: single-node or clustered Kubernetes
- 🔁 Your Ansible `multipass` role: boot, provision, join, destroy
This setup made local test clusters simple—until resource constraints from open-webui/Ollama pushed you to reprioritize. Now, with Iluvatar’s horsepower, you can toggle between:
- Local (WSL) clusters for tight-loop dev
- Mirkwood-based test clusters for longer-lived validations

## 📡 Bridging the Worlds
| Source | Target | Method | 
|---|---|---|
| WSL (Ubuntu) | Multipass VMs | [Ansible](https://github.com/dekeyrej/ecosystem-map/wiki/%F0%9F%A7%B0-Ansible-Roles-&-Orchestration-Strategy) (local transport) | 
| WSL | Proxmox (via Mirkwood) | Ansible + kubeconfig | 
| Multipass → Proxmox | Future idea: export snapshots or config with Ansible & cloud-init |  | 

## 🚦Future Considerations
- Could resurrect multipass-based test orchestration and let it mirror Mirkwood’s workloads
- May snapshot test cluster state from WSL → deploy into Mirkwood for consistent regression tests
- Perhaps codify WSL→Iluvatar sync flows (e.g., make deploy-test target)
