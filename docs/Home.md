Welcome to my ecosystem-map wiki!

All of my repositories are the result of my 'learning journey' with Python (with some JavaScript, etc. thrown in), and all applied to my 'Journeyman' project of creating my own version of the [Tidbyt](https://tidbyt.com/).

Since 2022, this project has evolved _considerably_ - starting as a microcontroller-driven (ESP32), standalone device with a single 64x32 pixel RGB LED panel, to it's current state as a collection of microservices running in a fully-virtualized Kubernetes cluster, and utilizing PostgreSQL as a backing datastore and Redis for messaging to feed 1) a Raspberry Pi 4B driving a 128x64 pixel array comprised of 4 RGB LED panels, and 2) a JavaScript web app (via a JavaScript API server).
